# Meetups-in-Space

This was a multi-day project at Launch Academy to demonstrate integrating PostgreSQL with a basic Sinatra Web App. I created the different models and views as well as their integrations minus the authentication for the user, which was provided in the assignment. The CSS was also provided.

This app shows my skills with ERB, PostgreSQL integration through ActiveRecord, and setting up different paths through the use of basic Ruby rather than relying on Rails magic.
